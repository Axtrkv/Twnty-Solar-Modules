Checkout page using HTML/CSS/TypeScript/React/React-router.

Features included in checkout page:

● list of available solar modules and their quantity fetched from the API

API was given to me in TT document, i fetched it with async/await function and i restructured it from {key : {values}} to an array for better data accessibility.

● possibility to select solar modules

I made the button - "Add to order". On which we click and value become true.

While we click on "Add to order button" total cost of order calculates the quantity and price of modules we have selected.

● form for order submitting that includes:
